A simple test runner that can be used to quickly see coverage.

Idea is that there will be multiple parts I think

1. The initial "console tester" that keeps running to check coverage and outputs data (json)
2. Consumers that read the json outputs, and do things with it 
   - Rider IDE plugin to show what lines are covered and not covered
